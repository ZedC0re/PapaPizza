== Summary

This document represents the specification book (SB, German: a "Pflichtenheft") of the project __{project_name}__ from the group swt21w19.
It provides an overview of the software product to be built and functions as a basis for communication between
the client and the development team.
This documents main purpose is to provide a foundation for a contract between the
client and the contractor, and should therefore be validated and checked for consistency.
Moreover, as requirements and circumstances constantly evolve during a project, adjustments are to be expected and have to be documented.
The SB describes what the desired system has to fulfill and partially how the contractor intends to implement the solution.
We aim to use this SB as a guideline over the course of the "Softwaretechnologie-Projekt" at Technische Universität Dresden (TU Dresden). 

== Task Definition and Goals

//@everyone
//@everyone

Our main client, the pizza service "Papa Pizza", delivers pizzas, salads and drinks to its customers.
Generally, the software is designed to assist the main tasks and services, that occur in the pizzeria.
It can only to be operated by the members of the "Papa Pizza" service personal, who have to log into the application.
The ordering process works as following:
A "Papa Pizza"-employee (cashier) can take orders from customers over the phone.
Due to security reasons the customer has to pass through his 6-digit TAN.
Therefore, first time customers have to sign up for a customer account in person, which can later be edited or deleted.
When signing up, they will receive their first invoice with a TAN.
Using this TAN customers can now place their next order by phone. 
After ordering the TAN will be invalidated and the customer needs a new one, which they can find on his latest invoice.
With their new TAN the customer is now able to place a new order.
If one loses their TAN, they have to go to the store and request a new TAN.

After verifying the customer with help of their TAN and phone number they can now place their order.
In the Order menu, the employee can create orders with custom pizzas, including several toppings, or choose from a variety of predesigned pizzas for the customer.
In Addition, an order can be delivered with one or more dining sets for a deposit of 15 € each.
If not returned, the rental will be considered as bought after one month of lending.
A customer placing an order above 30 € will also receive a free drink.
Moreover, the customer can decide to pick up his food instead of getting it delivered and receive a 10% discount.   
After confirming the order, every customer gets an estimated delivery time for his order, which shouldn't be more than 45 minutes.

Next, ordered pizzas will be placed in an automatically assigned oven (by an assigned chef).
Every pizza is being baked in the oven for exactly 5 minutes.

If the customer decides to get his order delivered to their address, the software will automatically assign driver(s), vehicle(s) and the concreate delivery(s) to their order.
One driver is able to deliver up to five different orders using one vehicle, which has a limited amount of slots (for order consisting items like e.g. pizzas, drinks, salads etc ).
This means, that an Order could be delivered by multiple drivers.
Every driver needs a sum of 15 minutes for delivering to exactly one address. 
This time consists of 7:30 min. driving to the customer and 7:30 min. driving back.
If the driver delivers food to multiple customers at once the time is calculated, so that the driver has one large way back to the pizza place.
This means, that the driver needs exactly 7:30 minutes from one customer to another.
The delivery closes off the ordering process.

The boss also serves as an admin in the software
They can basically see every action, that is done by any employee.
They can assign which employee shall work in which part of the restaurant. 
The boss is also able to hire/fire new employees or buy/sell ovens or vehicles when needed.
The number of pizza bakers, ovens and vehicles in use is determined by the boss, who makes this decision guided by the system (Analytics) once every quarter.
To help their decision they can see different graphs and past orders.
The boss is also able to see everything that is in the inventory, which consists of vehicles and ovens, pizza presets, salads, drinks, toppings and dish sets.
They can list/delist new items, add/delete pizza presets and so on.

Our software has to aid all those tasks while remaining clear and easy to use.


== Product Usage

The system is going to be used in a store with real application area.

The software is supposed to run on a server, that is not connected to the internet. The software will be executed on a completly local system.
The interfaces can be reached via the web browser.

The system shall be accessible and visually optimized for the following browsers:

    Mozilla Firefox, version 93.0+

    Google Chrome, version 95.0.4638.54+

The primary users of the software are staff members of the "Papa Pizza" restaurant. This means, that the customers will not be able to use the system and every interaction is made by either Employees or the Boss.

The system shall not need technical maintenance, as the staff isn't trained for technical support.
The Software is designed in a way that allows the boss to identify as an admin.
Any data shall be stored persistently in a database and be accessible through the application (e.g. no SQL knowledge should be required for a boss).


[[Stakeholders]]
== Stakeholders

In the table below, the stakeholders are listed, a priority is assigned (in case requirements should clash this allows for easier decisions)
and their high-level goals are described.

The assigned priorities range from 1 (lowest priority) to 5 (highest priority).

=== GUI Preview
This sections gives an overview of how the GUI could look like, once finished. The prototype is made with MS Powerpoint.

==== Login
[[gui_login]]
image::./models/analysis/gui/PP/01_login.PNG[Login Page,100%,100%,pdfwidth=100%,title="Login page",align=center]

The login page redirects each employee to their role-related frontpage, e.g. an employee who works as chef (role: 'KITCHEN')
will be redirected to the ``/kitchen`` page.

==== Navbar
[[gui_navbar]]
image::./models/analysis/gui/PP/02_navbar.PNG[Navbar only,100%,100%,pdfwidth=100%,title="Navbar only (not directly visible)",align=center]
Employees will not be able to see nor access the tabs dedicated to the 'BOSS', specifically 'EP MGMT', 'Inventory' & 'Analytics' will be hidden. +
They can see tabs of other roles (like 'Order', 'Kitchen', 'Delivery') though, but not edit.

==== Order
[[gui_order]]
image::./models/analysis/gui/PP/03_order.PNG[Order Page, 100%, 100%, pdfwidth=100%, title="Order page", align=center]

The ``New Order`` button redirects the employee to a new page ``/new_order`` as seen in the next image.

==== New Order
