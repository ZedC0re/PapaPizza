== Other
* in general:
- very nice looking and working application
- html request error pages are nice
- good workflow

* Icons are nice-looking, but sometimes dont have any description, kind of unclear what they show
    -> lower Icon changes to questionmark when clicking on a Product

* there’s no Customer Tab in the Navbar (admin)
* language selection only worked on some of our machines (some people got it working by changing the language (in e.g. chrome) itself & others not at all) [might be browser related issue]
* In general, high amounts are not displayed correctly
* The boss cannot be terminated. Problem: endless bosses
* The website is not scalable
* The Nav bar shows duplicate entries on the main page. Some entries are only displayed on the main page (Main page: [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/ ))
* generally nothing deleted from database upon deletion in system
-> generally ok, but kinda questionable from a customers point of view

== Improvement Suggestions
* other than the Bugs we found there were no big noticeable flaws
